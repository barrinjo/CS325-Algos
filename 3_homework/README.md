The knapsack DP vs Rec file can be run with "python3 knapsack.py"
It runs a bit too long for the N=30 and W=120 test that I used for data collection (2.5 minutes), so I changed the code to only test up to W=90 and N=26 to make it run within a reasonable time limit.

The shopping program takes no arguments and reads a file called "shopping.txt".  It can be run with "python3 shopping.py".  The results of the program are written to a file called "results.txt"
